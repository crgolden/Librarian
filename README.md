[![Quality gate](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/quality_gate?project=crgolden_Librarian)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=crgolden_Librarian)

The end-user surface of the PlayStation game-curation project: an **Angular 22 SSR** application
with a **Node.js Express** Backend-for-Frontend (BFF), served by a single Node process. The BFF holds
the OIDC session and proxies every data call to the standalone [Curator](https://github.com/crgolden/Curator)
API; the browser never sees an access token directly.

## Sibling Applications

| Repo | Role | How Librarian interacts |
|---|---|---|
| [Identity](https://github.com/crgolden/Identity) | OIDC Identity Provider | OIDC authorization-code flow via `openid-client` in the Node BFF |
| [Curator](https://github.com/crgolden/Curator) | PlayStation game-curation API | BFF proxies `/curator/api/**` via a `fetch`-based proxy (`src/bff/proxy.ts`), attaching the user Bearer token (scope `curator`) |
| [Infrastructure](https://github.com/crgolden/Infrastructure) | Health monitoring dashboard | Polls `GET /health` (returns `Healthy`) |

## Architecture

A single Node process runs both the Angular 22 SSR renderer and an Express BFF. The BFF owns the
OIDC session (`openid-client` v6, PKCE; scopes `offline_access openid profile email curator`),
proxies `/curator/api/**` to the Curator API with the session's Bearer token, and requires
`X-CSRF: 1` on mutating calls. The app surface covers a home page, a `/psn` settings page
(link/unlink a PlayStation Network account via NPSSO token, backed by Curator's `/me` and
`/psn/link` routes, plus per-category data-harvest preferences and bring-your-own-key RAWG/OpenCritic
enrichment key management), `/catalog` (browse the shared game catalog), `/collections` (create/save/run
curated collections), and `/library` (trigger a refresh and browse the caller's own library — server-side
search, category filtering, sortable columns, and paging; see "The library page" below) — all
backed by real Curator endpoints. A public social-profile feature adds `/profile` and its sub-keyed
counterpart `/u/:sub`: a viewable, followable profile with opt-in display toggles for library,
collections, PSN trophies, and PSN identity, plus always-visible follower/following lists. `/library` and
`/collections` are themselves now sub-keyed (`/library/:sub`, `/collections/:sub`) so the same components
render a read-only view of another user's library/collections when their profile makes that section
public; the bare paths always mean "mine," and a sub-keyed URL for your own sub redirects straight back to
the bare one. Frontend is zoneless Angular. Observability:
OTLP traces/metrics → Grafana Alloy; structured logs → Elasticsearch (`pino-elasticsearch`).
`GET /health` → `Healthy`.

## The library page

`/library` (your own, with a refresh button) and `/library/:sub` (read-only, another user's public
library) render the same table component (`src/library/`), backed by `GET /curator/api/library` and
`GET /curator/api/users/{sub}/library` respectively. Both endpoints are fully server-driven — the
Angular page never fetches the whole library into the browser and sorts/filters it client-side; every
search keystroke (debounced), category selection, column-header click, and page change issues a
fresh request with `q`/`category`/`sort`/`sortDir`/`limit`/`offset` query parameters, and the
response carries only that page's rows plus a `total` count.

Columns:

| Column | Source |
|---|---|
| Title | The game's canonical title |
| Category | The resolved genre Curator's enrichment pipeline assigned (same resolution `/catalog` uses) — not PSN's raw per-title genre tags |
| RAWG | RAWG's critic score, 0–100 |
| OpenCritic | OpenCritic's top-critic score, 0–100 |
| PS Store | PlayStation Store's own star rating (1–5), from Sony's official catalog API |
| PS Store page | A link to the game's PlayStation Store product page, opens in a new tab |

Any rating that hasn't resolved yet — enrichment still pending, or you haven't configured a
RAWG/OpenCritic key — shows as a dash rather than blocking the row. Table structure, sortable
headers, and pagination controls are built on [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table)
(`@tanstack/angular-table`) running in manual (server-driven) mode, not a hand-rolled comparator or
page-slicing implementation.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Node.js 22 / Express 5 |
| Auth / BFF | `openid-client` v6 + `express-session` + `connect-redis` |
| Frontend | Angular 22 SSR (`@angular/ssr`) |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry → Grafana Alloy (OTLP), `pino` → Elasticsearch |
| Hosting | Azure App Service (Linux, Node 22) |
| Secrets | Azure Key Vault (Managed Identity) |

## Getting Started

The full local stack needs the Identity server and the Curator API running, plus local config:

**Environment variables (set in your shell):**

```
OidcAuthority=https://localhost:7261
CuratorApiAddress=<local Curator API URL>
LibrarianClientId=<dev client id>
LibrarianClientSecret=<dev client secret>
SessionSecret=<at-least-32-chars-dev-secret>
```

Session storage defaults to an in-memory store (fine for local dev — sessions just don't survive a
restart). To use a local Redis instance instead, export `RedisHost=localhost` and `RedisPort=6379`
(the code's own default assumes Azure's TLS port, not a local non-TLS Redis) — `session.ts` picks
Redis automatically once `RedisHost` is set.

**Key Vault secrets required at runtime (production):**

Each is wired up as an App Service setting holding a `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=...)` reference, so
App Service resolves it from Key Vault at startup using the app's managed identity and hands it to the
process as an ordinary environment variable. The app has no Key Vault SDK dependency and makes no vault
calls of its own.

| Secret name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `LibrarianClientId` | OIDC client ID |
| `LibrarianClientSecret` | OIDC client secret |
| `ElasticsearchUsername` | Elasticsearch basic auth username |
| `ElasticsearchPassword` | Elasticsearch basic auth password |
| `RedisPassword` | Redis TLS password |
| `SessionSecret` | Cookie signing secret (≥ 32 chars) |

## Key pieces

- `src/server.ts` — Express entry: `/health`, request logging, session, `/bff/*`, `/curator/api` proxy, Angular SSR catch-all.
- `src/bff/*` — `openid-client` auth, session (Redis / in-memory), Curator proxy, CSRF.
- `src/environments/*` — per-environment config (notably SSR `allowedHosts`), swapped via `fileReplacements`.
- `instrumentation.mjs` — OpenTelemetry sidecar (OTLP→Alloy); `src/telemetry/logging.ts` — pino→Elasticsearch.

## Commands

```powershell
npm install
npm start            # ng serve — SPA/component dev (no SSR/BFF), http://localhost:4200
npm run build        # SSR production build → dist/librarian.client/{server,browser}
npm run build:ci     # SSR build with the ci environment (allowedHosts=localhost)
npm run serve:ssr    # run the full SSR + BFF: node --import ./instrumentation.mjs dist/librarian.client/server/server.mjs
npm run lint         # ESLint
npx vitest run       # unit tests (Vitest); add --coverage for LCOV
npm run e2e          # build:ci + Playwright E2E vs the real Node server + mock Curator/OIDC (self-builds)
npm run e2e:smoke    # Playwright smoke tests against a deployed stack (SmokeBaseUrl)
```

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the full E2E / smoke test guide and CI configuration.

## Deployment

Deployed to Azure App Service (Linux, Node 22) as `crgolden-librarian` via GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/main_crgolden-librarian.yml`) — build, SonarCloud analysis, Vitest + Playwright
E2E, then deploy and post-deploy smoke test. Secrets are Key Vault-referenced App Service settings
(`@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=...)`), resolved by the platform via the app's system-assigned managed
identity before the app starts — the app itself never calls the Key Vault SDK. See the workspace-level
[DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full hosting fleet and Key Vault reference.
